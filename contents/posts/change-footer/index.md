# Customize the Footer

![Cover Image](./assets/cover.jpg)

The footer is an important section of your website, often used to display additional navigation, social media links, or copyright information. Follow these steps to customize the footer in **Try-O**.

---

## Step 1: Edit the Footer Content

1. Open the **site.yml** file in your project directory.
   - This file contains the global configuration for your site, including footer content.

2. Locate the **footer-socials** section. Example:

   ```yaml
   footer-socials:
     - title: "Instagram"
       url: "https://instagram.com/"
     - title: "Facebook"
       url: "https://facebook.com/"
     - title: "YouTube"
       url: "https://youtube.com/"
     - title: "LinkedIn"
       url: "https://linkedin.com/"
   ```

3. Add, update, or remove social media links as needed:
   - **title**: The name of the social platform or link.
   - **url**: The URL for the social link.

---

## Step 2: Add Custom Links or Text

1. To include additional text (e.g., copyright notices or custom links), locate or add a section like this in **site.yml**:

   ```yaml
   footer-links:
     - label: "Privacy Policy"
       url: "/privacy-policy/"
     - label: "Terms of Service"
       url: "/terms-of-service/"
   ```

2. Modify the content to fit your requirements::
   - **label**: The text for the footer link.
   - **url**: The relative or absolute URL for the link.

---

## Step 3: Update Footer Styles (Optional)

1. Navigate to the **templates/default/views/partials/** directory. The footer layout is defined in the Mustache file: **footer.mustache**.

2. Edit the **footer.mustache** to adjust the structure, style, or additional content. Example:

   ```html
   <footer>
     <div class="footer-links">
       {{#footer-links}}
       <a href="{{url}}">{{label}}</a>
       {{/footer-links}}
     </div>
     <div class="footer-socials">
       {{#footer-socials}}
       <a href="{{url}}" target="_blank">{{title}}</a>
       {{/footer-socials}}
     </div>
   </footer>
   ```

3. Modify the CSS styles in **templates/default/assets/css/footer.css** to match your design preferences.

---

## Step 4: Change My site Â© 2025

Update the the "My site" copyright label in the bottom of the site by rewriting the title section in the **site.yml**:

   ```yaml
    baseUrl: "http://localhost:3000/"
    language: "en-US"
    title: "My site"
    description: "Description for my site"
   ```

---

## Step 5: Regenerate the Site

After updating the footer content or styles, regenerate the site to apply the changes:

1. Open your terminal and navigate to your project directory.
2. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   toucan generate
   ```

---

## Step 6: Verify the Footer Changes

1. Start the local development server:

   ```bash
   toucan serve
   ```

2. Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
3. Scroll to the footer section to verify that the updates have been applied

## Additional Notes

- **Dynamic Content**:
  - You can dynamically add more social or custom links by expanding the **site.yml** file.
- **Footer Layout**:
  - For advanced customization, create a new footer template or modify the existing **footer.mustache** file.
